## A bit about this project

This project deals with how the kernel size changes affect the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks, which are made for recognizing handwritten characters using the EMINST dataset. This experiment intends to find out how different kernel sizes influence learning efficiency and classification performances since several models will be trained with different kernel sizes.
