## A few key terms

1. "Convolution kernels, also known as filters, are small matrices used for the convolution operation. These kernels slide across the input data, performing element-wise multiplication with the corresponding pixels and producing a feature map that highlights specific patterns or features in the input."

## A bit about this project

This project deals with how the kernel size changes affect the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks, which are made for recognizing handwritten characters using the EMINST dataset. This experiment intends to find out how different kernel sizes influence learning efficiency and classification performances since several models will be trained with different kernel sizes.
