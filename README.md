# Science Fair 2025
### By Om Kanabar
This is my project for CPS science fair 2025.
## Goal of Project
The goal of the project is to make a lightweight neural network in Python for recognizing handwritten charecters (A-Z, 0-9). It will be trained on the EMNIST Mixed dataset.

## Overview
1. **IV:** Number of neurons per hidden layer 
- **Experimental Group**: 256, 512, 2048, 4096; 2<sup>8</sup>, 2<sup>9</sup>, 2<sup>11</sup>, 2<sup>12</sup>
- **Control Group** 1024, 2<sup>10</sup>
2. **DV:** 
```
accuracy/(accuracy + (model_time/2))
```

## How I did the experiment is available in the methods.md file.
